This is the desktop app of stock tracking system. Using electron to convert the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a desktop app. If you ask about the "customurl://" , it was for checking if the XAMPP is running or not. If XAMPP is not running, then the app will automatically start the XAMPP.

I should have use node.js and express as the backend server but this app should work just fine with the Codeigniter 3 PHP framework and MYSQL as database. Maybe in the future I will use node.js and express as the backend server.
